<p>I am a Phd candidate at the <a href="http://www.uga.edu">University of Georgia</a>. My research is cross-disciplinary, delving into both <a href="http://polisci.uga.edu/">political science</a> and <a href="http://www.terry.uga.edu/academics/offices/accounting">accounting</a>. In addition to my core training, I've completed advanced coursework in the <a href="http://www.stat.uga.edu/">statistics</a> department</p>

<p>My dissertation uses multiple Bayesian measurement models to examine the relationship between corporate political activity and corporate tax aggressiveness.</p> I also research measurement models, applications of social network analysis, Bayesian statistics, and Chinese politics.
