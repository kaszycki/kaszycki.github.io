		<p>My research intersects two distinctive (but not disjoint) disciplines: Political Science and Accounting. Having gained advanced training in both disciplines, I explore the ways in which the two areas inform each other.</p>
		<p>In particular, I study how political events influence firm activity. I explore topics including the empirical tax rate firms pay, corporate earnings management, the substance of disclosures, and firm accounting quality.</p>
		<p>I do so using modern statistical techniques, and a secondary interest of mine is research methodology, particularly Bayesian estimation and causal inference.</p>
