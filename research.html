		<p>My research agenda is interdisciplinary in nature. I explore the way in which corporate finance and accounting, political science, and public administration can inform each other.</p>
		<p>In my dissertation, I concentrate on politics and the effective tax rates that firms pay. This is a question of substantive interest for political scientists, as the implications of corporate political activity on the democratic process and the operations of businesses are a salient concern. And it is also of interest for accounting and finance fields, as estimating the effective tax rate, which is not disclosed in 10Ks, and the factors that may influence variation in the levels of ETR, is of interest. </p>
		<p>I am interested further in related topics concerning corporate political activity and business operation, as well as similar topics in the public sphere.</p>
		<p>I do so using modern statistical techniques, and a secondary interest of mine is research methodology, particularly Bayesian estimation and causal inference.</p>
